  user_question: what is wireshark
  bot_response: "Wireshark is a network packet analyzer that presents captured packet data in as much detail as possible. It can be thought of as a measuring device for examining what's happening inside a network cable, similar to an electrician using a voltmeter to examine what's happening inside an electric cable, but at a higher level. Wireshark is free and open-source, and it is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD. It uses the libpcap (Npcap) capture library, which supports microsecond resolution"</s>
